Overview
The Decentralized Voting System uses Ethereum for smart contract execution and Aptos for scalable and secure ledger management. This hybrid approach aims to provide a decentralized, transparent, and efficient voting platform. Voters can cast their votes securely, and results are recorded in an immutable ledger.

Features
Blockchain Integration: Combines Ethereum smart contracts with Aptos for a decentralized voting solution.
Immutable Ledger: Ensures votes are permanently recorded and cannot be altered.
Anonymity and Privacy: Protects voter identities and choices using cryptographic techniques.
Scalability: Utilizes Aptos for high throughput and low latency in handling large-scale elections.
Real-time Results: Provides up-to-date election results while preserving privacy.

Architecture
The system integrates Ethereum and Aptos as follows:

Ethereum Smart Contracts: Manage the voting logic, including registration, vote casting, and result calculation.
Aptos Ledger: Stores encrypted voting data to ensure scalability and performance.
Frontend Application: Interface for voters to interact with the system.
Backend Services: Facilitate communication between the frontend, Ethereum smart contracts, and the Aptos ledger.
